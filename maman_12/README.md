## Program Desciption
This program is represent a tree - each node in the matrix get index name from 0 up to N-1.
This tree represented by 2D array (matrix) by size of NxN, this matrix values received 0 OR 1.
if matrix index == 1 --> there is straight connection between u to v nodes (u is the father of v in the tree).
if matrix index == 0 --> there is NO straight connection between u to v node.
adjacency program include main method that received from the user 2D array (Matrix) of adjmat type, by size of NxN and print it. 
In addition received from the user two node from the tree (u,v) and return TRUE if there is path from those two nodes and FALSE if there is NOT
